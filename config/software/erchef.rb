  ## RUBY DEPSOLVER - REMOVE BUNDLER_BUSTER FOR ROLLBACK ##
  # Omnibus is run from within bunlder. Applications running from within
  # bundler have environment variables set that effect the sub-execution
  # of ruby code, especially instances of bundler. To install the ruby
  # based depsolver, the oc_erchef Makefile executes bundler to package
  # the application and its dependencies. For this not to effect the
  # ruby environment from which we run omnbius, we must clear the
  # currently set bundler environment variables. BUNDLER BUSTER does this.
