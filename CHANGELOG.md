# Chef Server Changelog

## 11.1.0

### Notable changes

* Addition of a ```chef-server-ctl upgrade command```  

    This allows an upgrade of the Chef server in place. It applies necessary SQL changes and other updates without having to install the server from scratch and without having to reimport data.

  **This feature can only currently be used on stand alone Chef server installs and assumes all services used by the Chef server are enabled.**

  **Only upgrades from 11.0.4 and newer builds of the Chef server are supported. For older installs, the knife download and upload process described in this [blog post](http://www.getchef.com/blog/2013/03/12/5106/) should be used.**

  **It is strongly encouraged that a data backup is performed first, in case something goes wrong.**

  **In the postgres logs, the following error may be present during an upgrade: ```ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "checksums_pkey"```. This is expected and does not represent an issue with the upgrade.**

  To use the upgrade command:
  ```
    chef-server-ctl stop # Ensure all the services shut down
    dpkg -i package.deb # or rpm -U package.rpm # Update the package on your system
    chef-server-ctl upgrade
    chef-server-ctl restart # Give the system time to bring all the services back up; restart is used to ensure all the config files are properly reloaded
  ```
  You can always check the status of the Chef server services with:

  ```chef-server-ctl status```

  If you're upgrading from a pre-11.0.8 version of the Chef server, see the section on the runit update below for a note on possible orphaned processes that may need to be cleaned up.

* Full IPv6 support  

    The Chef server now fully supports IPv6. In the chef-server.rb file, setting ```ip_version "ipv6"``` will turn on IPv6 mode. Note that no equal sign is used when setting this value. This will enable the Chef server to accept IPv6 connections internally and externally. The server will be in dual IPv4/IPv6 mode, so IPv4 connections will continue to function.

  By default the Chef server is in IPv4 mode only. IPv6 mode must  be explicitly enabled.

  Turning on IPv6 mode will automatically set the ```nginx['enable_ipv6']``` flag to true. If IPv6 mode is then turned off, this flag will be set back to false, unless the flag has been explicitly enabled. In the case the flag was explicitly enabled but IPv6 mode is turned off, nginx will continue to accept IPv6 connections, but the internal Chef server components will expect to communicate over IPv4.

  If a value like the bookshelf url is set to a literal IPv6 address, and not a hostname that will be resolved, then the IPv6 address will need to be bracketed (e.g. https://[2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348]) or else the Chef server will fail to recognized it as an IPv6 address.

  A change was also made to ensure that all the internal Chef server services listen for IPv6 addresses when this mode is enabled. This involved changing the default listen interface for these services to ```::``` (```*``` for postgresql), which cause them to listen on IPv6 and IPv4. The IPv4 default interface was also updated to ```0.0.0.0```. This is a change from the previous value of ```127.0.0.1```.

  Since the new IPv4 default setting is more permissive, some users may want to set it back to the old value. If the Chef server is being run in stand alone mode and not in a tiered setup (tiered isn't officially supported, but we know some users run in this mode), the default interface for IPv4 mode can be set back to ```127.0.0.1``` by setting the following attributes in the chef-server.rb to ```127.0.0.1```.

  ```
    bookshelf['listen']
    rabbitmq['node_ip_address']
    chef-solr['ip_address']
  ```
  The ```postgresql['listen_address']``` should be set to ```localhost``` instead of ```127.0.0.1```

  That will return the listen interfaces back to the defaults that existed in earlier versions of the Chef server.

  **Due to the change in these default listen interfaces it may be necessary to update firewalls rules or else set the listen addresses back to the old defaults.**

* Addition of ```nginx['enable_ipv6']``` option  

    Nginx is now included with IPv6 support available. To make use of this, there is an ```nginx['enable_ipv6']``` option that when set to true will cause nginx to handle IPv6 addresses. If full IPv6 support is enabled, this flag will be automatically set (see Full IPv6 support, above). If this flag is enabled without full IPv6 support being enabled, then the Chef server will be able to accept IPv6 connections, but the Chef server components will continue to operate in IPv4 mode internally.


* Added support for proxy/firewalls.  

    Chef server now supports working through proxies and firewalls by providing settings that expose where clients should retrieve cookbooks from.

  ```bookshelf['external_url']``` is the setting used to specify the URL from which the chef-client will download cookbooks. By default, this is the host header provided by the chef-client when it contacts the Chef server. When cookbook storage is located behind a firewall and/or when the host header is not used, this value must be a URL that is accessible to the chef-client.

  ```bookshelf['url']``` is the location the Chef server should use to store cookbooks.

* Change back to gecode depsolver

  With the 11.0 release, Chef server changed depsolvers from [gecode](http://www.gecode.org/) to an all [erlang depsolver](https://github.com/opscode/depsolver). The idea behind this was to drop the heavy nature of gecode, which has a considerable build time and large binary to ship. However, the experience of switching taught us that our erlang solution was not robust enough to solve all the dependencies that gecode could and that Chef users needed. Therefore with this release the depsolver switches back to using gecode. This switch should be transparent, but in some cases cookbook dependency resolution that was previously failing should work again.

  The change in depsolvers is accomplished through changes to the repo [chef_objects](https://github.com/opscode/chef_objects) and these changes are pulled in by the updated [erchef](https://github.com/opscode/erchef).

* Default RabbitMQ port change

  The default RabbitMQ port has been changed from 5672 to 8672. This was due to a conflict with the default port on RedHat 6 systems. The commit and rationale are can be seen in this [commit message](https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef-server/commit/b3bd2c4e20762b5f828953719e8fad56c6b3808e).

  For most users this change should not be an issue, but you may need to adjust the attribute on your systems if you're running in a tiered or HA setup.

* runit update

  This change was actually included in the 11.0.8 release, but if you're updating from an older version you should be aware of this.

  The runit that manages the Chef server processes was updated to no longer have opscode in its path and config names, switching to use chef-server instead. The change was made in this [commit](https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef-server/commit/10e571b85db3113818c2b1665e025e86d34e8654).

  While the commit in question attempts to ensure the old process is stopped, in some cases after upgrade orphaned processes have been observed (These are Chef server process that after upgrade instead of being managed by runit are attatched to init (PID 1). The upgrade completes successfully, but the orphaned processes have to be manually killed.

  To avoid this the following steps can be taken to stop all the Chef server processes before doing a package upgrade (*this does not apply when using chef-server-ctl upgrade - see below for instructions about this when doing a chef-server-ctl upgrade*). You'll need root or sudo access to perform these commands.

  If you're doing a package upgrade using your system package manager:

  ```
  initctl stop opscode-runsvdir

  chef-server-ctl graceful-kill

  pkill -9 -f epmd
  ```
  and then follow the upgrade path of your package manager of choice.

  A note on the steps take and the reasons for them. The first step stops the runit process under the old name so it doesn't resurrect any killed processes. Step two stops all the Chef server processes. Step three stops epmd, the Erlang port mapper deamon. Erlang starts a copy of this processes on all systems it runs on. This should actually be managed by runit, but due to an oversight it currently is not.

  With these steps taken a clean upgrade from a pre-11.0.8 install can be performed.

  If you're using the chef-server-ctl upgrade command:

  Run the upgrade using the directions described in the chef-server-ctl upgrade section. Do not follow the directions for doing a package upgrade that are immediately above in this section. After the upgrade, inspect the system for any orphaned processes. If orphaned processes are found, it doesn't mean the upgrade process failed. If the upgrade process reported it completed successfully, then it was successful. If orphaned processes exist, they can be safely killed.
